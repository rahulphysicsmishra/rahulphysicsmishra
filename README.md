# Hi, I’m Rahul

I’m an **AI Engineer & Developer** who loves building things end-to-end, from writing backend APIs to deploying AI models that solve real problems.

My journey into tech is a little different. I started out as a **national level yoga athlete and teacher**, even earning a Master’s in Yoga Science and teaching thousands in Rishikesh. That discipline and curiosity for deeper questions eventually led me into **coding and AI**, where I now explore how clarity of thought can be built into systems just like clarity of mind in yoga.

## What I Do

* Build and scale **applications** (frontend, backend, and full-stack).
* Design and deploy **AI/ML models** for real-world use cases.
* Teach and write articles that make **complex tech accessible**.
* Explore intersections of **health, mindfulness, and technology**.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS, UI/UX improvements
**Backend:** Python, Django, REST APIs, Database Design
**AI/ML:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Data Analytics
**Mobile:** Flutter (currently building projects)
**Other:** DSA, Git, APIs, Product Thinking, Cybersecurity Fundamentals

## Experience Highlights

* **CloudyML (3+ years)** → Product Head & Core Member

  * Built & scaled platforms (App, LMS, CRM)
  * Led a **25+ member team**
  * Balanced tech + product + growth (SEO, fundraising, sales insights)
* Currently focusing on **AI Engineering** → optimizing ML workflows, building scalable apps, and deepening fundamentals in data security.

## Beyond Tech

I believe yoga and AI aren’t separate worlds. Yoga trained me to ask the right questions; AI trains me to find the right answers. Both need clarity, discipline, and continuous learning values I bring to everything I build.
